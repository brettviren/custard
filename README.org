#+title: üçÆ custard

* Overview

*custard* provides two header-only libraries:

- [[file:custard.hpp]] stand-alone C++ interface to reading and writing
  tar streams via ~std::ostream~ (or derived)

- [[file:boost_custard.hpp]] ~boost::iostreams~ input filters ~tar_reader~ and
  output filter ~tar_writer~.  This depends on ~custard.hpp~

The filters require the user to follow a simple streaming protocol
which serializes 

1. file name 
2. file size (as string)
3. file body

The file name and file size strings must end with a newline ~\n~
character and the file body has no delimiter.

Subsequent files may be streamed by repeating this pattern.  For
examples see:

- [[file:test_boost_custard_write.cpp]] :: First argument is a tar file (~.tar~, ~.tar.gz~ or ~.tar.bz2~) to write and subsequent arguments give files to archive.

- [[file:test_boost_custard_read.cpp]] :: Single argument is a tar file (~.tar~, ~.tar.gz~ or ~.tar.bz2~) to read.  File names and sizes are printed.  No files are written.

Additional tar metadata is set automatically by *custard* and not
currently configurable.
