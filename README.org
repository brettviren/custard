* Overview

custard provides

- [[file:custard.hpp]] a C++ interface to reading and writing tar streams
  via ~std::ostream~ (or derived)

- [[file:boost_custard.hpp]] ~boost::iostreams~ tar input and output
  filters.

The filters follow a simple streaming protocol which is exposed to the
application.  A custard tar stream has three parts:

1. file name as stored in the archive (app should remove initial ~/~).
2. file size measured in bytes and represented as ASCII.
3. file body.

The first and the second shall has a newline ~\n~ character appended.
Note, the file body does not have an added newline.  Any number of
files may be streamed by simply repeating these triplets.

Additional tar metadata is set automatically and not currently
configurable.
